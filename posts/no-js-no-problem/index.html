				<p>In all honesty, I was repulsed by the idea of having a website for myself, where I showcase all the things I do. I don&rsquo;t really think I needed a website just to show people the &ldquo;things&rdquo; that I create. After all, the things I generally create don&rsquo;t have fancy UI&rsquo;s that one can browse online and marvel at. I generally write backend systems, and deploying those things takes a lot of time, and I <em>doubt</em> someone interested would actually take the trouble.</p>
<h2 id="do-i-even-need-a-website">Do I even need a website?</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s just easier to give people a link to a github account, and hand off the problem to someone else. You go to <em>that</em> site, and <em>you</em> figure out if you like the work that I do. If you need clarifications, you can create an issue, or ping me somewhere, or e-mail me. Should be easy enough, right?</p>
<p>Apparently, it&rsquo;s still nice to have a presence on the web, even if it is ephemeral, and the website may die down and burn to the ground one day. So, I have this nice fancy domain, that matches my username everywhere, which makes it easier to find me. I think it could come handy some day if I actually do some amazing stuff that I&rsquo;d want to talk about. The kinda content that goes crazy on hacker news and the likes of reddit.</p>
<h2 id="what-would-a-website-made-by-me-entirely-look-like">What would a website made by me entirely look like?</h2>
<p>Look, it&rsquo;s no secret, my knowledge of javascript is&hellip; lacklustre. Which seems like madness, every developer should have a rough idea of what it is, right? Well, I&rsquo;ve managed to go about life and earn money without ever writing a single line of javascript code that ran on production. Yes, I&rsquo;ve done a few changes here and there for testing stuff locally, but nothing that I would count as impactful. I dont know vuejs,reactjs or any of the other million or so frameworks that are <em>hot</em>. I simply don&rsquo;t have to care about them for now. So, this website has ZERO javascript. Yep, nothing. Not even analytics. I know most of people who would ever read this would be bots anyway.</p>
<h2 id="what-would-i-add-here">What would I add here?</h2>
<p>I currently use Notion nearly exclusively for writing. It is that good a tool. In fact, I would pay for it right now. I will probably export something from there onto here from time to time.</p>

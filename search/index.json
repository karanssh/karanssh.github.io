[{"content":"In all honesty, I was repulsed by the idea of having a website for myself, where I showcase all the things I do. I don\u0026rsquo;t really think I needed a website just to show people the \u0026ldquo;things\u0026rdquo; that I create. After all, the things I generally create don\u0026rsquo;t have fancy UI\u0026rsquo;s that one can browse online and marvel at. I generally write backend systems, and deploying those things takes a lot of time, and I doubt someone interested would actually take the trouble.\nDo I even need a website? It\u0026rsquo;s just easier to give people a link to a github account, and hand off the problem to someone else. You go to that site, and you figure out if you like the work that I do. If you need clarifications, you can create an issue, or ping me somewhere, or e-mail me. Should be easy enough, right?\nApparently, it\u0026rsquo;s still nice to have a presence on the web, even if it is ephemeral, and the website may die down and burn to the ground one day. So, I have this nice fancy domain, that matches my username everywhere, which makes it easier to find me. I think it could come handy some day if I actually do some amazing stuff that I\u0026rsquo;d want to talk about. The kinda content that goes crazy on hacker news and the likes of reddit.\nWhat would a website made by me entirely look like? Look, it\u0026rsquo;s no secret, my knowledge of javascript is\u0026hellip; lacklustre. Which seems like madness, every developer should have a rough idea of what it is, right? Well, I\u0026rsquo;ve managed to go about life and earn money without ever writing a single line of javascript code that ran on production. Yes, I\u0026rsquo;ve done a few changes here and there for testing stuff locally, but nothing that I would count as impactful. I dont know vuejs,reactjs or any of the other million or so frameworks that are hot. I simply don\u0026rsquo;t have to care about them for now. So, this website has ZERO javascript. Yep, nothing. Not even analytics. I know most of people who would ever read this would be bots anyway.\nWhat would I add here? I currently use Obsidian nearly exclusively for writing. I think I will get around to adding more content soon(maybe)\n","date":"2021-08-02T00:17:38+05:30","permalink":"https://karans.sh/p/no-javascript-no-problem./","title":"No JavaScript? No Problem."}]
